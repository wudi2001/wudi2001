## Hi there 👋

✨ I am a M.Sc. student from the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). And I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wangshuhui) (国家优青) and [Prof. Li Su](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~suli). 
🔭 My primary research interest lies in AI4Science. Specifically, I am engaged in the development of innovative deep learning frameworks aimed at modeling brain networks for the analysis of human brain diseases. In the future, I plan to expand my current work to integrate information from multimodal data, such as MRI and EEG. I welcome collaboration and communication with my peers in this area of research.
