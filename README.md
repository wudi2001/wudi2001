## Hi there 👋

✨ I am a M.Sc. student from the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). And I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shuhui Wang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~wangshuhui) (国家优青) and [Prof. Li Su](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~suli). My major research interest lies in AI4Science, in particular, I am developing some novel deep-learning frameworks to model brain networks for human brain disease analysis. In the future, I will extend current works to incorporate information from multimodal data (e.g., MRI and EEG). Welcome peers to communicate with me.
